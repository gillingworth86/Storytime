## Reddit Post Templates

### Template 1: Value-First Story Share (r/Parenting, r/Mommit, r/daddit)

**Title:** "I've been making up personalized bedtime stories for my daughter—here's one that worked really well"

**Post:**
```
My 5-year-old has been asking for bedtime stories where SHE'S the hero, and I've been making them up on the spot for weeks now.

The twist? I started keeping track and making sure characters and plot points continue from one story to the next. She's OBSESSED. She now asks "What happens to Whisper tonight?" instead of demanding the same book for the 100th time.

Here's one of the stories I wrote for her (changed her name to Maya):

[Include Story 1 from landing page copy]

The magic is that Whisper comes back in the next story, the garden is a persistent place, and by Story 7 she's teaching another kid the "flower language" she learned in Story 1. It's continuity, not just random stories.

Anyone else do something like this? I'm considering building a tool to help parents generate these kinds of connected stories automatically.

Would that even be useful, or am I solving a problem only I have?
```

**Follow-up comment if people are interested:**
```
Really appreciate all the interest! I threw up a quick landing page to test if this is worth building: [URL]

If you're interested in trying it when it's ready, you can join the waitlist there. First 10 stories would be free to test it out.

Would love any feedback on the concept!
```

---

### Template 2: Feedback Request (r/SideProject, r/roastmystartup)

**Title:** "Built a landing page to validate a personalized bedtime story product—tear it apart"

**Post:**
```
**Problem:** Parents run out of bedtime story ideas, kids want the same story every night, or parents don't feel creative enough to make up engaging plots.

**Solution:** AI-generated personalized bedtime stories that build a persistent "universe"—characters remember your child, plot lines continue, running jokes develop. Not just one-off story generation.

**Target:** Parents of kids aged 2-8

**Landing page:** [URL]

**What I need:**
- Does the value prop land, or is it confusing?
- Would you sign up for this as a parent?
- What's missing that would make you convert?
- Is $9.99/month reasonable, too high, or too low?

**Context:** This is a pure validation test. If I can get 100 signups in 3 weeks, I'll build it. If not, I'll pivot.

Roast away. Be brutal—I'd rather hear it now than after wasting time building something nobody wants.
```

### Template 3: Maker Story (r/daddit)

**Title:** "Made a tool to generate bedtime stories for my kid—she's now emotionally attached to an AI owl"

**Post:**
```
My daughter (5) wanted bedtime stories where she's the main character. I started making them up, but keeping continuity was hard—remembering character names, plot points, inside jokes.

So I started experimenting with AI to help me generate stories that actually REMEMBER previous events. Now there's this recurring owl character named Whisper who my daughter talks about like she's real.

Last night she asked "Will Whisper teach me something new tonight?" and I realized I've accidentally created a persistent story universe.

It's been working so well I'm considering building a proper tool for other parents. Put together a landing page to see if anyone else would find this useful: [URL]

Anyone else gone down a rabbit hole like this for their kids? I feel like I'm building a whole cinematic universe over here.
```

### Template 4: Australian Community (r/AusMums)

**Title:** "Aussie parent here—built something to help with bedtime stories, keen for feedback from local mums"

**Post:**
```
G'day! Melbourne parent here who's been struggling with the bedtime story routine. My kid wants new stories every night, but I run out of ideas by Tuesday.

I've been experimenting with AI-generated personalized stories that actually CONTINUE from night to night—same characters, ongoing plot lines, proper story universe. Think of it like a TV series where your kid is the star, not just random episodes.

Put together a landing page to test if other Aussie parents would find this useful: [URL]

First 10 stories would be free to try it out, then thinking around $9.99/month for unlimited.

Would love honest feedback from local parents:
- Does this solve a real problem for you?
- What would make this a must-have vs nice-to-have?
- Is the pricing reasonable?

Cheers for any thoughts!
```

### Facebook Post Templates

### Template 1: Recommendation Request (Soft Launch)

**Post:**
```
Quick question for the group—what do you all do when your kids want bedtime stories but you've run out of books/ideas?

My 5yo wants ME to make up stories every night, and I'm running on empty by Wednesday 😅

Has anyone found good tools or resources for this? Or do you just re-read the same books on repeat?
```

**Follow-up comment after discussion:**
```
Update: Thanks for all the suggestions! Funny enough, I've actually been working on a tool to help with this exact problem (AI-generated personalized stories that actually continue from night to night).

Put up a simple page here if anyone's interested: [URL]

Would love feedback from this group since you all GET the struggle!
```

---

### Template 2: Value Share First

**Post:**
```
I've been making up personalized bedtime stories for my daughter and discovered something magical—when you keep the same characters and make callbacks to previous nights, kids get HOOKED.

My 5yo now asks "What's Whisper the Owl doing tonight?" instead of demanding the same book for the millionth time.

Here's a sample story I wrote for her (changed her name here):

[Include Story 1]

The trick is that Whisper comes back in every story, and my daughter remembers everything. By Story 7, she was teaching a new character the "flower language" from Story 1.

Anyone else do this continuity thing with bedtime stories? It's been a game-changer for us!
```

**If people engage:**
```
So many of you asked about this! I've been testing out AI to help generate these kinds of continuing stories (since making them up every night is exhausting).

If anyone wants to try it when it's ready, I put up a waitlist here: [URL]

First 10 stories are free to test it out. Would genuinely love feedback from parents in this group!
```

## Twitter/X Strategy (Bonus Channel)

### Hashtags to use:
- #ParentingLife
- #BedtimeStories
- #ToddlerMom
- #ParentingTips
- #IndieHackers (for maker community)

### Tweet Template 1:
```
My 5yo asked "What happens to Whisper the Owl tonight?"

She's emotionally invested in an AI-generated bedtime story universe.

I accidentally built a Marvel Cinematic Universe for bedtime.

Testing if other parents want this: [URL]
```

### Tweet Template 2:
```
Bedtime story hack that's working incredibly well:

Instead of one-off stories, create a UNIVERSE.

Same characters return. Plot lines continue. Inside jokes develop.

My kid now asks "what happens next?" instead of "read it again."
