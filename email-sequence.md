# Email Follow-up Sequence

## Email 1: Welcome + Qualitative Research (Day 0)

**Subject:** Welcome to Storytime! Quick question...

**Preview text:** Help us build the perfect bedtime story experience

---

Hi [Name],

Thanks for joining the Storytime waitlist! We're building something special—personalized bedtime stories that actually *remember*, creating a persistent universe where your child is the hero.

But before we go any further, I'd love to hear from you:

**What's the hardest part about bedtime stories in your house right now?**

Hit reply and let me know. Is it:
- Running out of ideas for new stories?
- Your child wanting the "same story" every single night?
- Not having time to come up with engaging plots?
- Feeling like you're not creative enough?
- Something else entirely?

Your answer will directly shape what we build. And honestly? I just love hearing from fellow parents in the trenches.

Thanks for being here,
[Your name]
Founder, Storytime

P.S. Keep an eye out for a sample story in your inbox in a few days. I think you'll love where we're headed.

## Email 2: Sample Story (Day 3)

**Subject:** Here's what we're building ✨

**Preview text:** Meet Whisper the Owl in Maya's story universe

---

Hi [Name],

Remember when I asked about your biggest bedtime story challenge? So many of you mentioned running out of fresh ideas while your kids want *more, more, more*.

That's exactly why we're building Storytime.

Here's a glimpse of what we're creating—a sample from Maya's ongoing story universe:

---

**Maya and the Whispering Garden (Story 1)**

Maya pushed open the garden gate and gasped. The flowers glowed softly in the twilight, and a gentle "whoo" came from the old oak tree. A beautiful silver owl swooped down, landing on a low branch.

"Hello Maya," said the owl in a voice like wind chimes. "I'm Whisper, guardian of the Whispering Garden. We've been waiting for someone brave enough to hear the flowers' secrets. Would you like to learn their language?"

Maya nodded eagerly. Whisper touched her wing to Maya's forehead, and suddenly Maya could hear the roses giggling and the daisies singing soft songs. "You're a natural," Whisper smiled. "Tomorrow, I'll introduce you to the garden sprites. They've heard all about you."

---

**Here's what makes this different:**

This isn't just a one-off story. Tomorrow, Whisper returns. The garden sprites become friends. Maya learns and grows. By Story 7, she's teaching a new friend the flower language—showing real character development.

**Your child becomes invested** in this universe. They'll actually ask "What happens next?" instead of demanding the same story for the 47th time.

That's the magic we're building.

**What do you think?** Hit reply and let me know. Would this work for your family?

## Email 3: Feature Prioritization Survey (Day 7)

**Subject:** Quick favour? Help me prioritize

**Preview text:** 2-minute survey (+ early bird perks inside)

---

Hi [Name],

I need your help.

We're heads-down building Storytime, and I want to make sure we're prioritizing the features *you* actually care about—not just what sounds cool in our heads.

**Would you spend 2 minutes telling us what matters most?**

[Take the 2-minute survey]

Here's what we're trying to decide:

✅ Should we launch with just stories, or include audio narration from day one?
✅ How important are printable story collections vs digital-only?
✅ Would you want custom plushies of characters from your child's universe?
✅ What about companion games or activity sheets?
✅ Which additional features would make this a "must-have" vs "nice-to-have"?

**Everyone who completes the survey gets:**
- Early access when we launch
- 15 free stories instead of 10
- First dibs on custom plushies (if we build them)

Takes 2 minutes, shapes the entire product. Fair trade?

[Take the survey now]

Thanks for being part of this,
[Your name]

P.S. The survey includes a question about pricing. Heads up: we're considering a freemium model with 10 free stories, then around $9.99/month for unlimited. Thoughts welcome.

## Email 4: Pricing Validation (Day 14)

**Subject:** The awkward question: what would you actually pay?

**Preview text:** Honest answer = better product for everyone

---

Hi [Name],

Okay, let's talk money.

I know, I know—awkward. But here's the thing: if we price this wrong, we either build something unsustainable (and shut down), or price out the families who'd benefit most.

So I'm just going to ask directly:

**What would you pay per month for unlimited personalized bedtime stories in a persistent universe?**

Here's what you'd get:
- Unlimited stories starring your child
- A universe that remembers everything and builds continuity
- House characters like Whisper the Owl
- Age-appropriate, safe, reviewed content
- Ability to guide themes, lessons, and story directions
- Stories generated in ~30 seconds
- Future access to physical merchandise and companion games

**Our current thinking:**
- First 10 stories free (no credit card)
- Then $9.99/month for unlimited
- Cancel anytime, money-back guarantee if your kid doesn't love it

**Too much? Too little? Just right?**

Hit reply and be brutally honest. Would you pay that? What would make it a no-brainer yes? What would make you hesitate?

I read every reply, and your answer will directly influence our pricing model. No sales pitch here—just genuine curiosity about what's fair.

Thanks for being real with me,
[Your name]

P.S. We're about 3-4 weeks from launch. If you've been loving these emails and want to help spread the word, just forward this to another parent who might be interested. Every signup gets us closer to making this real.
