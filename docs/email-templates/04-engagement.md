**STORYTIME**

Hi there,

I have a question for you—and your answer will directly influence what we build first.

---

**What's the #1 thing that would make bedtime stories better for your family?**

Just hit reply and tell me. Could be:

• "My kid gets bored of the same themes"
• "I want stories that teach kindness without being preachy"
• "We need shorter stories for busy nights"
• "I wish we could save favorite stories"
• Something completely different!

No wrong answers. I read every reply personally.

**Why This Matters**

We're a small team building something new. Unlike big companies that build what they THINK parents want, we can actually build what you TELL US you want.

Your reply = real influence.

---

**Quick update on where we are:**

✅ Story generation engine working
✅ Character persistence working
🔄 Building the parent dashboard
⏳ Launch coming soon

You'll be among the first to know when it's ready.

Thanks for being on this journey with us. Seriously—it means a lot.

Now, hit reply and tell me: what would make bedtime stories better?
