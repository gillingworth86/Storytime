**STORYTIME**

Hi there,

Remember Maya and Whisper the Owl from my first email? Let me show you how their story EVOLVED over a week of bedtimes.

---

**Night 1**
Maya meets Whisper in the Whispering Garden. Whisper teaches her to understand the language of flowers.

**Night 3**
The garden sprites need help! Maya uses her new flower-language skills *(callback!)* to solve the mystery. Whisper is proud.

**Night 7**
A new child, Luna, discovers the garden. Maya—now confident—becomes the teacher, showing Luna what Whisper taught her.

---

See what happened? Maya GREW. She went from student to teacher. The story remembered her journey.

---

**Here's what powers this:**

🧠 **Story Memory** - Each story builds on the last

👤 **Character Persistence** - Whisper remembers everything

🎭 **Character Growth** - Your child's character evolves

🌍 **Universe Building** - New locations unlock over time

And yes, it all happens automatically. You just say "another adventure" and the magic continues.

---

We're putting the finishing touches on the first version now. Early waitlist members (that's you!) will be first to try it.

One more email coming in a few days. I have a question for you that will actually shape what we build.

Until then,
The Storytime Team
