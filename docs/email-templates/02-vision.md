**STORYTIME**

Hi there,

Last year, my daughter asked me something that stopped me in my tracks.

*"Dad, can we have the same story, but different?"*

She wanted to see her favorite character again—but in a NEW adventure. She wanted continuity. She wanted a universe that remembered.

I looked for an app that could do this. Generate personalized stories? Sure, plenty of those. But stories that REMEMBER? Characters that RETURN? A universe that GROWS?

Nothing.

**The Problem**

Every AI story app I found had the same issue: amnesia. Each story started fresh. No memory. No callbacks. No "remember when we saved the forest sprites?" No inside jokes. No beloved companions returning.

It felt... hollow.

**The Vision**

Storytime is different. We're building:

✨ **Persistent characters** who remember your child
🌙 **Story arcs** that span weeks and months
🦉 **House characters** (like Whisper the Owl) who become true companions
📚 **A universe** that grows richer with every bedtime

Your child won't just hear stories. They'll LIVE in a story universe that's uniquely theirs.

---

That's what I'm building. And I'd love for your family to be part of it.

Next time, I'll show you exactly how the "story memory" works. It's pretty magical.

Talk soon,
The Storytime Team

P.S. - Still curious about your child's current favorite story! Hit reply if you have a moment.
