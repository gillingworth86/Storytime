## Strategic Decisions

### SD-001: Email Automation Platform (Deferred)
**Status:** Deferred until demand validation
**Decision Date:** TBD (after 100 signups)
**Affects:** F005, F008, and any future automation needs

**Context:**
Buttondown (chosen for F002) requires $29/mo for automations. Kit offers 1 free automation but requires serverless proxy (more complex implementation).

**Options:**
| Option | Cost | Complexity | Limitations |
|--------|------|------------|-------------|
| Buttondown Standard | $29/mo | Low (CORS) | None |
| Kit Free | $0/mo | High (proxy) | 1 automation, branding |
| Kit Creator | $39/mo | High (proxy) | None |

**Decision:**
- **Manual-first approach** for F005 until demand validated
- Send welcome emails manually via Buttondown dashboard
- Reassess platform choice when:
  - 100 signups achieved (demand validated), OR
  - Manual sending becomes unsustainable (>10 signups/day)

**Rationale:**
- Don't pay $29/mo before validating product-market fit
- Manual sending is acceptable for <100 subscribers
- Preserves flexibility to switch platforms if needed
- Aligns with lean validation philosophy

**Review Trigger:** 100 email signups OR 3 weeks elapsed

---

## Notes

- Feature IDs are sequential (F001, F002, etc.)
- Priority may change based on validation learnings
- Effort estimates are for single developer
- All P0 features must complete before Phase 2
- Review backlog weekly during Phase 1
- Strategic decisions documented in SD-XXX format

---

## Future Considerations (Not included in F002)

Not included in F002, consider for future:
Name field collection (Q-006 revisited)
Personalization opportunity
Higher friction (test impact)
Email preferences
Frequency selection
Topic interests
Child age/gender
Welcome email series
Email #1: Immediate confirmation
Email #2: Story about product vision
Email #3: Sneak peek at features
Email #4: Reminder to whitelist
Referral program
Share link with friends
Rewards for referrals
Move up waitlist
Waitlist position
"You're #47 in line!"
Gamification
Urgency/FOMO
A/B testing
Different CTAs
Different form copy
Different value props
Advanced analytics
Heatmaps
Session recordings
Funnel analysis
Email verification (beyond double opt-in)
Real-time email validation API
Catch typos (did you mean @gmail.com?)
Block disposable emails
Progressive profiling
Collect additional info over time
Not all at once (reduce friction)
These should have their own PRDs when prioritized
