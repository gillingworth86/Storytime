## 🤔 Decision Points

### If you hit 100 signups:
✅ Validated! Begin building MVP
✅ Send pricing survey to validate $9.99/month
✅ Plan beta launch for subscribers

### If you don't hit 100 signups:
⚠️ Analyze why:
- Low traffic? Distribution problem
- High traffic, low conversion? Messaging problem
- Lukewarm feedback? Product-market fit problem

⚠️ Pivot or shelve:
- Test different value props
- Target different audience
- Or move to next idea

**Either way: You validated or invalidated in 3 weeks for $40. That's a win.**
