# Storytime CI/CD Setup Guide (Netlify - Deprecated)

> ⚠️ **Deprecated:** Storytime has migrated to Vercel. Netlify deployment setup is no longer used for this repository.
>
> - Active deployment platform: **Vercel**
> - Active config file: `vercel.json`
> - Historical Netlify config: `netlify.toml.backup`
> - Historical Netlify workflow: `.github/workflows/landing-page-ci-cd.yml.backup`

## Why this file still exists

This document is intentionally retained as historical reference for rollback investigations and audit history.

## Current setup path

Use the Vercel migration and project docs instead:

- `VERCEL-MIGRATION.md`
- `README.md`
- `QUICKSTART.md`

## Netlify references policy

Any Netlify references in this repository should be treated as **deprecated historical context**, not active operating instructions.
