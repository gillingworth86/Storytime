# Layer 1 (Drives) – Research Validation

## Purpose
Structural stress-test of the 9 candidate drive nodes and key intra-layer edges against established empirical motivation research. Three checks: node validation, edge validation, gap test. This is not a literature review – it is convergent evidence assessment.

## Frameworks Used

| Framework | Key Contribution |
|---|---|
| Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan) | Empirically derived universal psychological needs |
| Maslow's Hierarchy | Foundational needs taxonomy (used critically) |
| McClelland's Needs Theory | Achievement, affiliation, power as primary motivators |
| Attachment Theory (Bowlby, Ainsworth) | Belonging and safety as foundational developmental drives |
| Terror Management Theory (Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski) | Meaning, safety, transcendence under mortality salience |
| Evolutionary Social Psychology (Buss, Kenrick, Tooby & Cosmides) | Drive universality via adaptive function |
| Self-Expansion Theory (Aron & Aron) | Competence, novelty, and growth as motivational mechanisms |
| Effectance Motivation (White) | Competence as irreducible, intrinsic drive |
| Sociometer Theory (Leary) | Status and recognition as social inclusion monitoring mechanisms |

## Check 1: Node Validation

### BELONGING
- SDT identifies *relatedness* as one of three universal psychological needs. Strong direct support.
- Attachment theory constructs its entire developmental model on the belonging/connection drive as foundational.
- Evolutionary social psychology: group membership was a survival mechanism; social exclusion triggers threat responses (Eisenberger et al. – social pain activates same neural regions as physical pain).
- **Verdict: Strongly supported. One of the best-evidenced nodes.**

### STATUS
- McClelland's *need for power* partially maps here – the social dominance and influence dimension.
- Sociometer Theory (Leary): self-esteem functions as a gauge of social rank and inclusion threat – status monitoring is continuous and pre-conscious.
- Evolutionary social psychology: status hierarchies are universal across cultures and pre-human primates; high status confers resource access and mate selection advantage.
- Distinction from belonging supported: social exclusion (belonging threat) and status loss activate different responses and different coping strategies.
- **Verdict: Strongly supported. Distinct from belonging as hypothesised.**

### SAFETY
- Maslow places safety as the second foundational tier – more fundamental than social drives. Directionally useful though the hierarchy itself is poorly supported empirically.
- Attachment theory: the secure base concept confirms safety as a precondition for exploratory behaviour; threat activates proximity-seeking.
- TMT: the entire framework is built on safety/anxiety management under existential threat.
- Evolutionary: threat detection systems (amygdala response) are universal and pre-conscious.
- **Verdict: Strongly supported. The most foundational node in the set.**

### AUTONOMY
- SDT identifies *autonomy* as one of its three universal psychological needs – arguably the most extensively empirically tested of all our nodes.
- Reactance theory (Brehm): restriction of behavioural freedom produces measurable motivational resistance – pre-conscious and universal.
- Cross-cultural SDT research (Chirkov et al.) confirms autonomy need universality across collectivist and individualist cultures, addressing the obvious objection.
- **Verdict: Strongly supported. Best-evidenced node in the set alongside Belonging.**

### MEANING
- TMT: meaning systems (cultural worldviews) function as anxiety buffers under mortality salience – meaning is not just desirable but functionally necessary.
- Frankl's logotherapy and subsequent empirical work (Steger et al.): meaning in life is a universal motivational orientation distinct from pleasure or achievement.
- Cross-cultural universality of myth, narrative, and ritual as meaning-making structures – no known culture operates without them.
- SDT adjacent: *purpose* appears in extensions of SDT beyond the original three needs.
- **Verdict: Strongly supported. TMT provides the strongest mechanistic evidence.**

### COMPETENCE
- SDT identifies *competence* as one of its three universal psychological needs. Direct support.
- White's effectance motivation (1959): the drive toward competence is intrinsic, not derived from external reward – predates SDT and provides independent convergent evidence.
- Self-Expansion Theory (Aron): growth through competence acquisition is a primary motivational mechanism.
- Intrinsic motivation research (Csikszentmihalyi's flow): optimal challenge relative to skill is the primary flow trigger – confirms competence drive operates independently of reward.
- **Verdict: Strongly supported. Three independent research traditions converge.**

### RECOGNITION
- Sociometer Theory: self-esteem tracks *individual social value* not just group membership – supports recognition as distinct from belonging.
- Kohut's self-psychology: *mirroring* (being seen and validated as an individual) is a distinct developmental need from attachment.
- However: Recognition does not appear as an explicit universal need in SDT, and its cross-cultural universality is less rigorously established than the SDT triad.
- Narcissistic injury research supports the distinct wound produced by being ignored vs rejected vs outranked – three different responses to three different drive threats.
- **Verdict: Moderately supported. Less empirically robust than other nodes but mechanistically distinct. Inclusion justified; flag for integration testing.**

### PLAY
- Brown (Stuart Brown, National Institute for Play) and Burghardt: play is universal across mammals and evidenced in all human cultures.
- Panksepp's affective neuroscience: PLAY is one of seven primary-process emotional systems, neurologically distinct from others.
- Winnicott's developmental psychology: play is not derivative of other drives – it is a primary mode of engagement with reality.
- Distinct from novelty: play research consistently shows it is the *mode* (non-instrumental, intrinsically motivated, process-oriented) not the content that defines it.
- **Verdict: Strongly supported. Panksepp's neurological evidence particularly strong for irreducibility.**

### NOVELTY
- Berlyne's arousal theory: novelty-seeking is a primary motivational system tied to optimal stimulation levels – distinct mechanism from competence or play.
- Sensation-seeking research (Zuckerman): individual variation in novelty drive has biological substrate (dopaminergic), but the drive itself is universal with variable intensity.
- Self-Expansion Theory: novelty is a distinct expansion mechanism alongside competence.
- Weakest case for irreducibility: some research treats novelty as a component of competence-seeking (encountering the edge of capability) rather than independent.
- **Verdict: Moderately supported. Provisional status confirmed. Distinct enough from Play and Competence to retain but the irreducibility case is the weakest in the set.**

### TRANSCENDENCE
- Maslow's later work explicitly added transcendence above self-actualisation – less empirically grounded than his earlier tiers but theoretically significant.
- Panksepp does not identify transcendence as a primary emotional system – notable absence.
- Cross-cultural universality of ritual, ecstatic practice, and collective effervescence (Durkheim) supports a universal mechanism oriented toward self-boundary dissolution.
- Keltner's awe research: awe (a transcendence-adjacent state) produces consistent cross-cultural physiological and behavioural signatures, supporting a universal mechanism.
- SDT extensions (Martela & Sheldon) propose *transcendence/contribution* as a fourth need candidate.
- **Verdict: Moderately supported. Universal mechanism evidenced but less empirically robust than core nodes. Provisional status confirmed.**

### CONTRIBUTION/BENEFICENCE
- Martela & Sheldon SDT extension: propose *beneficence* as a fourth universal psychological need, distinct from the original SDT triad. Direct support for irreducibility.
- Prosocial motivation research (Batson): altruistic motivation has a distinct mechanistic substrate from belonging-maintenance or meaning-seeking behaviour.
- Warm glow research: immediate positive affect from prosocial behaviour has a distinct neurological signature (oxytocin response) separable from social acceptance and meaning-coherence circuitry.
- Critical irreducibility test: prosocial impulses clinically survive meaning collapse and can precede and restore meaning rather than requiring it as input. If contribution were derivable from meaning, meaning collapse should suppress it - this does not consistently hold.
- Feedback relationship with meaning: contribution generates meaning longitudinally (feedback edge) rather than requiring meaning as a precondition - this is what makes it appear derivable when it is mechanistically distinct.
- **Verdict: Moderately supported. Closest call in the set. Irreducibility case rests primarily on the clinical evidence and the SDT extension research. Included on that basis.**

## Check 2: Edge Validation

### Safety–Autonomy: CONFLICT
- SDT: when basic needs are thwarted, autonomy is typically the first casualty – people trade autonomy for safety under threat conditions.
- Threat-rigidity theory (Staw et al.): resource threat produces centralisation, conformity, and reduced exploratory behaviour – autonomy suppressed by safety activation.
- **Verdict: Strongly supported.**

### Belonging–Status: CONFLICT
- Sociometer Theory: the tension between inclusion (belonging) and differentiation (status) is a central mechanism – standing out risks exclusion.
- Cross-cultural research on conformity pressure: group belonging norms consistently suppress individual status-seeking behaviour.
- However: Cialdini's research on in-group status shows belonging and status can be complementary *within* a group context while conflicting *at the group boundary*. Supports the conditional edge noted in the matrix.
- **Verdict: Supported with nuance – conflict is the primary relationship but the within-group vs boundary context matters. The conditional flag in our matrix is validated.**

### Autonomy Cluster Complementarity (Autonomy–Play–Novelty–Competence)
- SDT's mini-theory of intrinsic motivation: autonomy, competence, and relatedness are jointly required for intrinsic motivation – autonomy and competence are explicitly complementary.
- Flow research: autonomy + competence + novelty (challenge at the edge of skill) are the three conditions for flow states – convergent evidence for the cluster.
- Play research: play is definitionally autonomy-dependent (it ceases to be play under coercion) – the complementarity edge is structural, not incidental.
- **Verdict: Strongly supported. The cluster is the most empirically robust structure in the graph.**

### Safety–Meaning: COMPLEMENTARITY
- TMT: meaning systems (cultural worldviews) are the primary anxiety buffer under existential threat – meaning directly serves safety. Activation of mortality salience increases investment in meaning systems.
- **Verdict: Strongly supported. TMT is essentially a study of this specific edge.**

### Belonging–Transcendence: COMPLEMENTARITY
- Durkheim's collective effervescence: shared ritual produces simultaneous belonging and self-transcendence – the two drives are co-satisfied by the same mechanism.
- Sports, music, religious practice as modern examples: all produce the dual activation.
- **Verdict: Supported.**

### Status–Transcendence: CONFLICT
- Less directly evidenced in research literature. Logical case holds (self-dissolution vs self-assertion) but limited empirical testing of this specific pairing.
- **Verdict: Logically supported, empirically under-tested. Flag for integration testing.**

## Check 3: Gap Test

Drives identified in established frameworks not currently in our node set:

| Candidate | Source Framework | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Power/Influence over others** | McClelland; Adlerian psychology | Partially captured by Status but McClelland treats it as distinct – the drive to *control others* vs the drive to *rank above others*. Earmarked as Layer 3 Trait (control-seeking disposition) per discard register. Worth monitoring in integration testing. |
| **Relatedness/Intimacy beyond belonging** | SDT extensions; attachment theory | Attachment theory distinguishes proximity-seeking (belonging) from felt security and intimate knowing. Supports our decision to earmark Intimacy for Layer 4 (behaviours) but raises question of whether a distinct attachment *drive* is missing. |
| **Contribution/Beneficence** | Martela & Sheldon SDT extension; prosocial motivation research | The drive to benefit others, distinct from belonging (acceptance) and meaning (coherence). Not currently in our node set. Moderate case for inclusion – some research treats it as derivable from belonging + meaning, others treat it as irreducible. **Flag for reconsideration.** |
| **Fairness/Reciprocity** | Trivers reciprocal altruism; moral foundations theory | Confirmed as derivable (our discard decision holds) but the research volume is high enough to warrant noting it as a strong Layer 3 trait candidate. |

## Actions for Integration Testing

1. **Power/Influence** – monitor in integration testing; current placement as Layer 3 trait may need revisiting.
2. **Status–Transcendence conflict edge** – flag for integration testing; logically sound but empirically under-tested.
3. **Recognition** – monitor in integration testing; mechanistically distinct but least empirically robust.
4. **Belonging–Status conditional edge** – validate the within-group vs boundary context distinction when building Layer 4 behaviour nodes.
5. **Contribution irreducibility** – retest during integration; if scenario testing shows it consistently decomposes into Belonging + Meaning outputs, demote to discard register.
