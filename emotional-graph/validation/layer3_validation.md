# Layer 3 (Traits) – Schema Definition and Validation

## Layer Definition
Stable dispositional tendencies that modulate how states express as behaviours. Individual-variable (not universal), relatively durable across time and situation. Traits do not cause behaviour directly – they shape which behaviour a given state produces, and at what threshold states activate.

---

## Validity Criteria

- **Stable** – relatively durable across time and situation; not fluctuating day to day
- **Individual-variable** – meaningfully differs between people; not universal
- **Dispositional** – a tendency to respond or express in particular ways; not an act
- **Modulating** – shapes how states convert to behaviour, or adjusts state activation thresholds
- **Indirectly observable** – inferred from patterns of behaviour across situations; not directly visible in a single act
- **Social-emotional scope** – must be relevant to interpersonal functioning

**Exclusions:** drives (universal), states (transient), behaviours (observable acts), values (consciously held beliefs), cognitive abilities (intelligence, memory – different domain)

**Intra-layer edge types:**
- **Potentiates** – one trait amplifies the expression of another
- **Inhibits** – one trait suppresses or counterbalances another
- **Correlates** – traits that empirically tend to co-occur (without causal relationship)

## Note on Design
This layer is where the seed insight (charm vs sincerity) formally lands. The framework is built to analyse traits as independent dimensions – the charm/sincerity 2×2 is an example of the kind of analysis Layer 3 enables. Traits in this layer are deliberately not bundled; their relationships are encoded as intra-layer edges, not merged nodes.

## Node Candidates and Evaluation

### CHARM
The ability to create positive affect and engagement in others through social interaction. A skill-like trait – it can be developed and is context-activatable. Distinct from warmth (which is dispositional positive orientation) and from sincerity (which is authenticity of expression). High charm can co-occur with low sincerity (the charming manipulator) or high sincerity (the magnetically genuine person).  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### SINCERITY
The stable tendency toward authentic expression over performed or strategic expression. Distinct from honesty (a value) – sincerity is a dispositional tendency, not a moral commitment. High sincerity means internal state and external expression are consistently aligned. Can co-occur with high or low charm.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### EMPATHY
Sensitivity to and resonance with others' emotional states. Two components often distinguished: affective empathy (feeling with others) and cognitive empathy (accurately modelling others' states). For this framework, treated as a unified trait with those as sub-dimensions. Modulates how anger, guilt, and shame states express – high empathy suppresses aggressive behaviour and amplifies reparative behaviour.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### WARMTH
Positive dispositional orientation toward others. Distinct from empathy (which is sensitivity/resonance) and agreeableness (which is conflict-avoidance). Warmth is the baseline affective stance toward people in general. Modulates how belonging and contribution drives express across all states.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓ (distinct enough from empathy and agreeableness to warrant own node)**

### DOMINANCE
Tendency to assert influence, control, and direction in social situations. Distinct from assertiveness (which is about direct expression of own needs/positions). Dominance is about the social hierarchy dimension specifically. Modulates how anger, pride, and defensiveness states express.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### ASSERTIVENESS
Tendency to express needs, positions, and boundaries directly. Distinct from dominance (which is hierarchy-oriented) and from agreeableness (opposite pole). Assertiveness is about direct self-expression regardless of hierarchical intent. Modulates how anger, vulnerability, and resentment states express.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### AGREEABLENESS
Tendency toward accommodation, harmony-seeking, and conflict avoidance. Big Five construct with strong empirical support. Modulates how anger, defensiveness, and shame states express – high agreeableness suppresses confrontational behaviour and amplifies placating/conforming behaviour.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### EXTRAVERSION
Social energy orientation and stimulation preference. Big Five construct. Modulates state activation thresholds (extraverts activate excitement more readily; introverts activate vulnerability and overstimulation more readily in social contexts) and behaviour selection (amplifies performing, storytelling, attention-seeking).  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### OPENNESS
Receptivity to novelty, new experience, and ideas. Big Five construct. Distinct from curiosity as a trait (which is specifically exploratory motivation) – openness is broader and includes aesthetic and intellectual receptivity. Modulates boredom threshold and novelty drive expression.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### CONSCIENTIOUSNESS
Reliability, follow-through, organisation, and self-regulation. Big Five construct. Relevant to interpersonal functioning through its effect on how guilt, pride, and resentment states express – high conscientiousness converts guilt into action rather than rumination.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### EMOTIONAL STABILITY
Baseline volatility of state activation. The inverse of Big Five Neuroticism. Not a state itself – it is the trait that determines how readily states activate and how intensely they register. Low emotional stability means states like anxiety, shame, and anger activate at lower thresholds and with greater intensity.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### RESILIENCE
Capacity to recover from adverse states. Distinct from emotional stability (which governs activation threshold) – resilience governs recovery rate. High resilience means shame, grief, and anxiety states are shorter in duration regardless of activation intensity. Modulates the longitudinal feedback from states to trait formation.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### RISK TOLERANCE
Comfort with uncertainty, potential loss, and unknown outcomes. Distinct from openness (which is about receptivity to novelty) – risk tolerance specifically governs the safety drive's constraining effect on behaviour. High risk tolerance means safety-threat states (anxiety, vulnerability) produce less behaviour suppression.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### CURIOSITY (TRAIT)
Stable orientation toward exploration and inquiry. Distinct from curiosity as a state (Layer 2) – the trait is the dispositional baseline that determines how readily the curiosity state activates and how persistently it sustains behaviour. People high in trait curiosity activate the curiosity state at lower novelty thresholds.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### VULNERABILITY TOLERANCE
Capacity to remain in and act from states of exposure without collapsing into defensive or avoidant behaviour. Brown's research: vulnerability tolerance is the primary determinant of whether vulnerability state produces connection (disclosure) or disconnection (withdrawal). Distinct from resilience (recovery) and emotional stability (activation threshold).  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### HUMOUR
Tendency to engage with experience through levity, play, and comic reframing. Distinct from play drive (which is a motivation) – humour as a trait is the stable disposition to access the play mode in social interaction. Modulates how anger, boredom, and vulnerability states express. Cross-cultural evidence for humour as a distinct social trait.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓ (provisional – borderline between trait and behaviour pattern)**

### FAIRNESS-ORIENTATION
From discard register. Stable sensitivity to violations of reciprocity and proportionality. Modulates how anger and resentment states express – high fairness-orientation produces stronger state activation in response to perceived inequity. Distinct from justice-orientation (which is abstract/systemic).  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### CONTROL-SEEKING
From discard register. Stable tendency to manage and constrain the behaviour of others and outcomes in the environment. Distinct from dominance (which is hierarchy-oriented) – control-seeking is specifically about reducing uncertainty by managing external variables. Modulates how anxiety and jealousy states express.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

## Discarded Candidates

| Candidate | Reason | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| Justice-orientation | Largely redundant with fairness-orientation at the interpersonal level; abstract systemic dimension is a value not a trait | Merge conceptually into fairness-orientation |
| Narcissistic tendency | Better understood as a drive configuration (high STA + high REC + low empathy) than a trait in its own right; fails parsimony | Flag for integration testing as a drive combination pattern |
| Perfectionism | Derivable from high conscientiousness + high competence drive sensitivity; fails irreducibility | Flag for integration testing |

## The Charm/Sincerity 2×2 (Seed Insight Formalised)

| | High Sincerity | Low Sincerity |
|---|---|---|
| **High Charm** | Magnetic/Genuine – creates trust and attraction simultaneously | Manipulative/Charismatic – engaging but instrumentally motivated |
| **Low Charm** | Earnest/Abrasive – authentic but socially unpolished | Flat/Disengaged – neither engaging nor genuine |

This 2×2 is an example of the analytical output Layer 3 enables when traits are treated as independent dimensions. The same logic applies to any trait pair in this layer.
