# Layer 4 (Behaviours) – Schema Definition and Validation

## Layer Definition
Observable interpersonal expressions. The only layer directly visible to others. The output of all lower layers – drives activating states, modulated by traits, expressing as behaviour. Behaviours are the diagnostic entry point: analysis starts here and traces downward.

---

## Validity Criteria

- **Observable** – directly visible to others without inference; the behaviour itself, not what it signals
- **Interpersonal** – involves at least implicit reference to or impact on others
- **Discrete** – recognisable as a named pattern; not so granular as to be a micro-expression, not so broad as to be a category
- **Drive-neutral** – the same behaviour can serve different drives in different people (e.g. withdrawing can serve safety or autonomy)
- **Trait-mediated** – the same state can produce different behaviours depending on trait configuration
- **Not a state** – not an internal condition; the act not the feeling
- **Not a trait** – not a stable disposition; behaviours are instances, traits are tendencies

**Exclusions:** internal states, stable dispositions, drives, social roles (too contextual), specific verbal content (too granular), long-term relationship patterns (emergent from behaviour sequences, not single nodes)

**Intra-layer edge types:**
- **Escalates** – one behaviour triggers a more intense or further behaviour
- **Substitutes** – behaviours that serve the same function and commonly alternate
- **Inhibits** – one behaviour makes another less likely

## Node Candidates and Evaluation

### WITHDRAWING
Reducing engagement, presence, or responsiveness in social interaction. Universal, observable, and drive-neutral – can serve SAF (avoiding threat), AUT (protecting self-determination), or BEL (punishing through absence). The most fundamental defensive behaviour.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### MIRRORING
Reflecting another person's language, affect, posture, or behaviour back to them. Primary belonging and rapport-building mechanism. Can be conscious (performed) or unconscious (automatic). Drive-neutral – serves BEL (connection) or STA (influence) depending on motivation.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### DOMINATING
Asserting control over the direction, pace, or outcome of an interaction. Distinct from assertiveness (which is expressing own position) – dominating is about subordinating others. Serves STA and AUT drives primarily.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### PERFORMING
Presenting a curated, managed self rather than responding spontaneously. Distinct from mirroring (other-directed) – performing is self-directed. Serves STA, REC, and BEL drives. Observable through the managed, effortful quality of the presentation.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### HELPING/CAREGIVING
Actively providing assistance, resources, or support to others. Serves CON and BEL drives primarily. Distinct from nurturing (which is developmental, longer-term) – helping/caregiving is situationally responsive.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### COMPETING
Seeking advantage, primacy, or superiority relative to others in a shared context. Serves STA and CMP drives. Observable through comparison-seeking, score-tracking, and effort-signalling.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### COLLABORATING
Pursuing shared goals through joint effort and mutual contribution. Distinct from helping (which is one-directional) – collaborating is reciprocal. Serves BEL, CON, and CMP drives.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### SEEKING REASSURANCE
Soliciting validation, confirmation, or comfort from others. Serves SAF and BEL drives. Observable through repeated checking, approval-seeking, and anxiety-signalling.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### CONFORMING
Aligning behaviour, expressed views, or presentation with group norms. Serves BEL and SAF drives. Distinct from collaborating (which is active joint effort) – conforming is passive alignment.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### REBELLING
Opposing, violating, or actively subverting group norms or expectations. Serves AUT drive primarily; also signals STA differentiation. Distinct from challenging (which is targeted at a specific position or person).  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE
Revealing internal states, uncertainties, or perceived weaknesses to others. Serves BEL and CON drives; requires vulnerability tolerance trait. Observable through unsolicited self-revelation and emotional transparency. The behaviour most strongly predicted by trait configuration (sincerity + vulnerability tolerance).  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### BOUNDARY-SETTING
Asserting limits on others' behaviour toward the self. Serves AUT and SAF drives. Distinct from dominating (which controls others) – boundary-setting defends self rather than subordinating others.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### CHALLENGING
Questioning, opposing, or directly contesting another's position, claim, or behaviour. Serves AUT, MEA, and fairness-orientation drives/traits. Distinct from rebelling (which opposes norms generally) – challenging is targeted.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### SIGNALLING STATUS
Communicating relative rank, capability, or social value through behaviour. Serves STA and REC drives. Observable through name-dropping, achievement-referencing, credential display, and effort-signalling. Drive-neutral at the observational level – can be conscious or automatic.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### NURTURING
Supporting the development, growth, or wellbeing of another over time. Distinct from helping/caregiving (situational, responsive) – nurturing is developmental, sustained, and future-oriented. Serves CON, BEL, and MEA drives.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### DEFLECTING
Redirecting attention away from the self, a topic, or a feeling. Serves SAF drive primarily. Observable through subject changes, humour as avoidance, and generalising from specific to abstract. Distinct from withdrawing (which reduces engagement) – deflecting maintains engagement while avoiding exposure.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### PLACATING
Appeasing others to reduce conflict or tension, often at own expense. Serves SAF and BEL drives. Distinct from collaborating (which is joint effort) and conforming (which is norm-alignment) – placating is specifically about managing another's emotional state. Observable through excessive agreement, apology, and self-minimisation.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### STORYTELLING
Using narrative self-presentation to construct meaning, connection, or identity. Serves MEA, REC, and BEL drives. Observable as a preferred mode of communication across contexts. Distinct from performing (managed self-presentation) – storytelling is narrative-structured and typically more sincere.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓ (provisional – sits close to performing; distinction is the narrative structure and meaning-making function)**

### INTIMACY-BUILDING
From discard register. Progressive mutual disclosure and deepening of connection over time. Serves BEL and REC drives. Distinct from vulnerability disclosure (single act) – intimacy-building is a sequential behaviour pattern. Behavioural sequence: self-disclosure → reciprocity → deepening → trust. Observable through the systematic progression of topics and depth.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### CONTROLLING BEHAVIOUR
Restricting, managing, or constraining others' options and behaviour. Serves SAF and AUT drives (via control-seeking trait). Distinct from dominating (which is about directing interaction) – controlling behaviour is specifically about limiting others' freedom. Observable through gatekeeping, surveillance, and option-restriction.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### ATTENTION-SEEKING
Drawing social focus toward the self. Serves REC and STA drives. Distinct from performing (which is self-curation) and signalling status (which is rank communication) – attention-seeking is specifically about volume of focus regardless of content.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

## Discarded Candidates

| Candidate | Reason | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| Contempt (expression) | Observable behaviour but better understood as a state-behaviour compound; the expression is too tightly bound to the state | Noted in Layer 2 discard log |
| Humour/levity | As a behaviour, it's the observable expression of the humour trait; retained as trait not behaviour node to avoid duplication | Layer 3: Traits (Humour) |
| Flirting | Too contextually specific; decomposes into mirroring + signalling status + vulnerability disclosure in romantic context | Emergent from behaviour combinations |
| Listening actively | Insufficient interpersonal distinctiveness as a behaviour node; better captured as mirroring + collaboration baseline | No placement |

| Challenging | Dominating | Targeted challenge escalates to broad control assertion |
| Placating | Conforming | Appeasement behaviour generalises to norm-alignment |
| Competing | Dominating | Competitive behaviour escalates to subordination behaviour |
| Vulnerability disclosure | Intimacy-building | Successful disclosure initiates the intimacy sequence |
| Mirroring | Intimacy-building | Sustained mirroring creates the safety for disclosure |
| Attention-seeking | Performing | Attention drive activates self-curation |
