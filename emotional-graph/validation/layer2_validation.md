# Layer 2 (States) – Schema Definition and Validation

## Layer Definition
Transient internal conditions triggered by situational events interacting with drives. The mechanism through which drives become activated and push toward behaviour. States are felt, time-limited, and motivationally charged.

---

## Validity Criteria

- **Transient** – time-limited; not stable across situations
- **Internally experienced** – felt condition with affective quality; not directly observable
- **Drive-activated** – triggered by the threat, deprivation, or satisfaction of one or more Layer 1 drives
- **Motivationally charged** – creates directional pressure toward behaviour
- **Pre-behavioural** – the internal condition preceding the act, not the act itself

**Exclusions:** drives (universal and stable), traits (stable dispositions), behaviours (observable acts), purely cognitive states without affective charge, moods (too diffuse and chronic to be states)

**Intra-layer edge types:**
- **Triggers** – one state activates another in sequence
- **Suppresses** – one state inhibits or dampens another
- **Co-occurs** – states that arise simultaneously from the same drive activation event

## Node Candidates and Evaluation

### ANXIETY
Drive source: SAF threat (primary), BEL threat, MEA collapse  
Universal, transient, clearly motivational. The most broadly evidenced state in clinical and social psychology. Pushes toward safety-restoring behaviour.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### SHAME
Drive source: BEL collapse + REC collapse (simultaneous)  
Distinct from guilt: shame is about the self being defective (I am bad); guilt is about an action violating a norm (I did something bad). The distinction is empirically robust (Tangney & Dearing). Pushes toward hiding, withdrawal, or defensive anger.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### GUILT
Drive source: CON norm violation (primary); BEL norm violation secondary  
Motivates reparative behaviour. Distinct activation profile from shame – guilt is other-focused, shame is self-focused. Suppresses rather than inflames defensive responses.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### LONELINESS
Drive source: BEL deprivation (chronic absence, not acute loss)  
Distinct from grief (which is BEL loss – permanent) and anxiety (which is SAF threat). Loneliness is the ache of connection absence. Pushes toward proximity-seeking behaviour.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### ANGER
Drive source: AUT violation (primary); SAF threat, fairness violation secondary  
Universal, cross-cultural, pre-conscious activation. Pushes toward boundary-assertion or retaliation behaviour. Distinct from resentment (which is anger that has become chronic and internalised).  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### GRIEF
Drive source: BEL loss (perceived permanent)  
Distinct from loneliness (deprivation, implicitly reversible) and anxiety (active threat). Grief is the response to irreversible connection loss. Pushes initially toward withdrawal; later toward meaning-making.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### CURIOSITY
Drive source: NOV + CMP co-activation  
Berlyne's arousal theory and Loewenstein's information gap theory both support curiosity as a distinct motivational state. Pushes toward exploration and engagement. Distinct from excitement (which is anticipatory and safety-tinged).  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### AWE
Drive source: TRN activation (primary); MEA + BEL secondary  
Keltner's awe research confirms cross-cultural physiological and behavioural signatures. Pushes toward stillness, narrative, and prosocial behaviour. Distinct from excitement and inspiration.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### ENVY
Drive source: STA threat via upward social comparison  
Distinct from jealousy (BEL threat via third party). Envy is dyadic (I want what you have); jealousy is triadic (I fear losing you to them). Smith & Kim's envy research supports the distinction. Ambivalent motivational charge – can push toward competing or toward inspiration.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### JEALOUSY
Drive source: BEL threat via third party (triadic structure)  
Empirically and phenomenologically distinct from envy. Pushes toward controlling behaviour, reassurance-seeking, or withdrawal.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### FLOW
Drive source: CMP + AUT + NOV optimal co-activation  
Csikszentmihalyi's flow is the most extensively documented positive state in motivation research. Requires challenge-skill balance (CMP), self-direction (AUT), and engagement with the edge of known (NOV). Distinct phenomenology: loss of self-consciousness, time distortion, intrinsic reward.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### BOREDOM
Drive source: NOV + PLA + CMP deprivation  
Eastwood et al.: boredom is a distinct aversive state (not merely absence of stimulation) with its own motivational profile – pushes toward stimulation-seeking. Distinct from loneliness and resentment.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### EXCITEMENT
Drive source: NOV activation + sufficient SAF (anticipatory)  
Distinct from curiosity (which is exploratory) and from awe (which is self-dissolving). Excitement is anticipatory, forward-directed, and energising. Requires safety threshold to be met – without it, the same novelty produces anxiety instead.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### VULNERABILITY
Drive source: SAF exposure without immediate threat  
Brown's vulnerability research positions it as a distinct state – the felt exposure of uncertain outcome. Motivationally ambivalent: can push toward disclosure (connection-seeking) or toward defensive closure. Trait-sensitive: high vulnerability tolerance produces very different behaviour from low.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### RESENTMENT
Drive source: AUT violation (chronic, unresolved)  
Distinct from anger (acute) – resentment is anger that has calcified through repeated violation without resolution. Nietzsche's ressentiment and contemporary emotion research both support the distinction. Pushes toward passive resistance, withdrawal, or covert sabotage.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### INSPIRATION
Drive source: MEA + CON co-activation  
Thrash & Elliot's inspiration research: inspiration is a distinct motivational state (not merely enthusiasm or excitement) with specific triggers and behavioural outputs. Characterised by evocation, transcendence, and approach motivation. Pushes toward creative or prosocial action.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### PRIDE
Drive source: CMP + STA + REC satisfaction  
Distinct from happiness (diffuse) – pride is specifically self-evaluative and tied to achievement or identity. Tracy & Robins: pride has universal expression and is cross-culturally recognised. Sustains status-seeking and competence-building behaviour.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓ (borderline composite but distinct motivational profile justifies inclusion)**

### DEFENSIVENESS
Drive source: SAF + STA simultaneous threat  
Distinct from anxiety (SAF only) and anger (AUT violation). Defensiveness is specifically triggered by perceived attack on self-concept or position. Pushes toward deflection, counter-attack, or justification behaviours. Empirically documented as a barrier to feedback integration.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### DISGUST
Drive source: SAF violation (moral/contamination); BEL norm violation secondary  
Haidt's moral foundations research: social disgust is a distinct state from physical disgust but shares the same rejection/expulsion motivational profile. Pushes toward distancing, challenging, or exclusion behaviours.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

### MORTALITY SALIENCE
Drive source: SAF existential threat (death awareness activation)  
From discard register. TMT's core construct – the state activated when death awareness is heightened. Distinct activation profile: pushes toward meaning system reinforcement, legacy behaviour, in-group bonding, and out-group derogation.  
**Verdict: Confirmed ✓**

## Discarded Candidates

| Candidate | Reason | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| Humiliation | Derivable from Shame + public context; context is a prompt input not a node | Layer 4 context note |
| Contempt | Primarily a behavioural expression (facial, social) rather than internal state | Layer 4: Behaviours |
| Elation | Composite intensity variant of Pride + Excitement; fails parsimony | No placement – emergent from node combinations |
| Satisfaction | Too diffuse; functions as absence of drive threat rather than distinct state | No placement – baseline condition |
